In order to run CLARA you will need:

* a sym link to the "extensions" directory of the NetLogo installation 
  in the current working directory of the model execution
* a subdirectory with the exact name of the "test" that you are running
  in the current working directory of the model execution (e.g. "./test")
* behaviorspace.sh (or some other similar run script derived from this)
  configured to run the appropriate test (and automatically create the 
  properly named subdirectory for you)

Edit "behaviorspace.sh" for site/machine-specific changes
